### Eris
by Jeven  
v2.4

### About

Eris is an action packed defence style Minecraft PvP map. 

In this asymmetrical battle, players are divided into invading and defending 
teams. The Invaders objective is to destroy the redstone core before it becomes
fully charged. The core will take 15 minutes to charge, and once it is fully
charged, the Defenders will win!

After a match has ended, use the in map admin options to swap sides! Try to defend
longer than your opponent, or mount a faster invasion.

Eris is balanced to be played with 7 of your friends (4v4), but it will also 
support gameplay for anywhere between a 3v3 to a 6v6.
