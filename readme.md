### Eris
by Jeven  
v2.3

### About

Eris is an attack/defend destroy the core Minecraft PvP map where the objective as 
the invaders is to destroy the redstone core before it becomes fully charged. The 
core will take 15 minutes to charge, and once maximum charged is reached, the 
defenders will win!

Eris is balanced to be played with 7 of your friends (4v4), but it will also 
support gameplay for anywhere between a 3v3 to a 6v6.

### Technical information

To install, extract the folder "Eris 2.3" from the downloaded "Eris 2.3.zip".
Then move the "Eris 2.3" folder into a Minecraft server directory.
Finally set the server.properties "level-name" property to "Eris 2.3".
	level-name=Eris 2.3
For installation help feel free to tweet me your questions (@NotJeven).
	
Eris v2.3 is released for unmodified (vanilla) Minecraft 1.12.2.

When a new snapshot or release of Minecraft is published, the Twitter account 
@ErisUpdates (http://twitter.com/erisupdates) will post whether or not the map
is supported for the new version of Minecraft. The supported Minecraft versions 
will also be added to the Eris webpage (http://github.com/notjeve/eris).

I recommend setting announce-player-achievements to false in server.properties.
	announce-player-achievements=false

Any bugs/map issues, please report them to the @ErisUpdates Twitter account
(http://twitter.com/erisupdates) or to the project github page 
(github.com/notjeven/eris).
