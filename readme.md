	v2.2

=================================================================================

	About:

Eris is an attack/defend destroy the core Minecraft PvP map where the objective as 
the invaders is to destroy the redstone core before it becomes fully charged. The 
core will take 15 minutes to charge, and once maximum charged is reached, the 
defenders will win!

Eris is balanced to be played with 7 of your friends (4v4), but it will also 
support gameplay for anywhere between a 3v3 to a 6v6.
