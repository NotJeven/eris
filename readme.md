	v2.1

===================================================================================

	About:

Eris is an attack/defend destroy the core Minecraft PvP map where the objective as 
the invaders is to destroy the redstone core before it becomes fully charged. The 
core will take 15 minutes to charge, and once maximum charged is reached, the 
defenders will win!

Eris is balanced to be played with 7 of your friends (4v4), but it will also 
support gameplay for anywhere between a 3v3 to a 6v6.

	Technical information:
For installation help feel free to tweet me your questions (@JevenMC) or post a
question in the comments area on http://jevenlabs.net/eris
	
Eris v2.1 is released for unmodified (vanilla) Minecraft 1.8.

When a new snapshot or release of Minecraft is published, the Twitter account 
@ErisUpdates (http://twitter.com/erisupdates) will post whether or not the map
is supported for the new version of Minecraft. You may also check the sidebar at
http://jevenlabs.net/eris to view the supported versions.

I recommend setting announce-player-achievements to false in the server.properties.
	announce-player-achievements=false

Also set enable-command-block to true in the server.properties file.
	enable-command-block=true

Any bugs/map issues, please report them to the @ErisUpdates Twitter account
(http://twitter.com/erisupdates) or the Eris comments area on jevenlabs.net 
(http://jevenlabs.net/eris).
